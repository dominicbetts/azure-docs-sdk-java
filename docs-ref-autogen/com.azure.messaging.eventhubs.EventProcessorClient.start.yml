  summary: |-
    Starts processing of events for all partitions of the Event Hub that this event processor can own, assigning a
     dedicated <xref uid="PartitionProcessor" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">PartitionProcessor</xref> to each partition. If there are other Event Processors active for the same
     consumer group on the Event Hub, responsibility for partitions will be shared between them.
     <p>
     Subsequent calls to start will be ignored if this event processor is already running. Calling start after <xref uid="#stop()" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">#stop()</xref> is called will restart this event processor.
