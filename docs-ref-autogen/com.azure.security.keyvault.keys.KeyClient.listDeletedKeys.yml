    Lists <xref uid="DeletedKey" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">deleted keys</xref> of the key vault. The deleted keys are retrieved as JSON Web Key structures
     that contain the public part of a deleted key. The Get Deleted Keys operation is applicable for vaults enabled
     for soft-delete. This operation requires the <code>keys/list</code> permission.
