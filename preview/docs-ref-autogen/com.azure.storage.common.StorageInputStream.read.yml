    Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If
     no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method blocks
     until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

  summary: |-
    Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array <code>b</code>. The number
     of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file
     is detected, or an exception is thrown. If the length of <code>b</code> is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is
     returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is
     at the end of the file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into
     <code>b</code>.

     The first byte read is stored into element <code>b[0]</code>, the next one into <code>b[1]</code>, and so on. The
     number of bytes read is, at most, equal to the length of <code>b</code>. Let <code>k</code> be the number of
     bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements <code>b[0]</code> through <code>b[k-1]</code>,
     leaving elements <code>b[k]</code> through
     <code>b[b.length-1]</code> unaffected.

     The <code>read(b)</code> method for class <xref uid="InputStream" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">InputStream</xref> has the same effect as:

     <code>read(b, 0, b.length)</code>

  summary: |-
    Reads up to <code>len</code> bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to
     read as many as <code>len</code> bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is
     returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
     exception is thrown.

     If <code>len</code> is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
     least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned;
     otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into <code>b</code>.

     The first byte read is stored into element <code>b[off]</code>, the next one into <code>b[off+1]</code>, and so
     on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to <code>len</code>. Let <code>k</code> be the number of bytes
     actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements <code>b[off]</code> through <code>b[off+k-1]</code>,
     leaving elements <code>b[off+k]</code> through
     <code>b[off+len-1]</code> unaffected.

     In every case, elements <code>b[0]</code> through <code>b[off]</code> and elements <code>b[off+len]</code>
     through <code>b[b.length-1]</code> are unaffected.

     The <code>read(b, off, len)</code> method for class <xref uid="InputStream" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">InputStream</xref> simply calls the method
     <code>read()</code> repeatedly. If the first such
     call results in an <code>IOException</code>, that exception is returned from the call to the
     <code>read(b, off, len)</code> method. If any
     subsequent call to <code>read()</code> results in a <code>IOException</code>, the exception is caught and treated
     as if it were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into <code>b</code> and the number of bytes
     read before the exception occurred is returned. The default implementation of this method blocks until the
     requested amount of input data
     <code>len</code> has been read, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. Subclasses are encouraged to
     provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
