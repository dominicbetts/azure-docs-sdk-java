  summary: |-
    Constructs a relative path between this path and a given path.
     <p>
     Relativization is the inverse of resolution. This method attempts to construct a relative path that when resolved
     against this path, yields a path that locates the same file as the given path.
     <p>
     A relative path cannot be constructed if only one of the paths have a root component. If both paths have a root
     component, it is still possible to relativize one against the other. If this path and the given path are equal
     then an empty path is returned.
     <p>
     For any two normalized paths p and q, where q does not have a root component,
         <code>p.relativize(p.resolve(q)).equals(q)</code>
  parameters:
  - description: the path to relativize against this path

  syntax: public Path relativize(Path path)
  returns:
    description: the resulting relative path, or an empty path if both paths are equal
